This simulation is an example of how boolean models can be integrated into Paul Macklin's team PhysiCell simulation using PhysiBoSS, in order to integrate more mechanistic details into cell-specific intracellular models.

### Run locally :

Download the git folder using git clone and access the src folder :

```
git clone https://github.com/marcorusc/Invasion_GUI
cd Invasion_GUI/src
```
compile the project and move the executable into the bin folder :

```
make
cp myproj ../bin
```

exit src and run the notebook :

```
cd ..
jupyter notebook
```

it could be necessary to export the CACHEDIR, if so :

```
export CACHEDIR=~/Invasion_GUI/tmpdir
```

Note that by default, on MacOS, the compiler is Clang and it is not providing support for OpenMP. To solve this, please install gcc, and use it to compile the project with these extra parameters : 

```
make PHYSICELL_CPP=<gcc C++ compiler>
```

For example : 
``` 
make PHYSICELL_CPP=g++-12
```
